I am Ph.D. candidate in experimental physics at Cornell University. My advisor is Dan Ralph. I am studying spin generation and transport in exotic material thin film systems and the utility thereof for driving thin film magnetic dynamics with applications for new memory technologies. In less technical terms, my research is about finding materials that can efficiently cause magnets to jiggle through the use of a small electrical current. It turns out that this is a technically relevant and non-trivial problem.

In my free time I make things. With another graduate student at Cornell, I have built two RepRap-based 3D printers (we used the first one to make the second). I have also machined Teflon, Delrin, aluminum, stainless steel, copper, brass, and Macor for various personal projects and experimental setups around the lab.  In addition to making static things, I have made reactive, luminescent clothing for electronic dance music festival goers and for the Cornell Fashion Collective Fashion Show. This includes designing and hand-populating custom <abbr title='Printed circuit boards'>PCB's</abbr>.
