The above banner image a rendering of each orbital band in a nine orbital (1xS,3xP,5xD) nearest neighbor FCC tight-binding model for arbitrarily chosen parameters of bond strength. The x and y axes are kx and ky, the z-axis is energy with kz=0 for plots. The yellow coloration in two of the surfaces is added for purely aesthetic reasons.

This website is meant as an online repository of things I have written up that may or may not be useful to the world as well as to serve as a portfolio.
